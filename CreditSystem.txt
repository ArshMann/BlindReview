CREDIT FLOW------------------------

1. Posting a submission
Author requests N (review_goal) reviews of submission:
Cost = N * credits_per_review
Subtract Cost from credits_available
Add Cost to credits_escrowed

2. Claiming a review slot
Reviewer can claim a review slot so that a submission does not receive more reviews than its review_goal
Reviewer must submit the review within a certain timeframe after claiming review slot
Reviewer can only hold 1 claim at a time (possibly more depending on reputation)
If Reviewer fails to submit review within timeframe, claim expires and they face some penalty

3. Submitting a review -> Quality check
Review goes through automated quality check
If passed, it becomes available to Author
Author completes quality check form
Quality check form is scanned and Reviewer's reputation is updated
Reviewer may repeal the reputation change
If Author claims in quality check form that the review is unnacceptable, moderator will check the claim and decide if
the review is indeed unacceptable
If it is deemed unacceptable, Author does not spend credits and Reviewer does earn credits, and Reviewer may receive
penalty
Otherwise:
Review has credits granted (subtract the submission's credits_per_review from Author's credits_escrow and
add them to Reviewer's credits_available)
